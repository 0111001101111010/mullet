# The Mullet Stack

[Facebook](http://facebook.github.io/react/) in the front. [Walmart](http://walmartlabs.github.io/hapi/) in the back.

All sitting on top of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

Get the Party Started
----

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

Setup the mullet stack:
```
git clone https://github.com/lynnaloo/mullet
cd mullet
npm install
```

OR 

Install the mullet npm module:

```
npm install mullet
```

Start the Mullet Server:
```
npm start
```

Party On
----

Point your browser to `http://localhost:8000` to see the index page!

But Seriously
----

This setup is a decent starting place to play around with Node.js, Hapi, and React.js.

Note: The React.js setup is similiar to the [React tutorial](https://github.com/reactjs/react-tutorial), but this could be upgraded to instead use the CommonJS module instead.
